Re-engineered compiler
----------------------

At this moment, the `Nanoc::Compiler` class has grown organically and has gained too many responsibilities. It needs to be re-thought and re-engineered so that it will become easier to maintain and so that hopefully [NEP-0009](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/neps/NEP-0009-Parallellize-the-compilation-process/) will become easy to implement.

Some responsibilities that the current compiler class has are the following:

* Create `ItemRep`s for all items
* Assign paths to `ItemReps` (routing rules)
* Remembering what is being compiled (the stack) so that dependencies can be tracked correctly
* Calculating the rule memory for each item rep
* Deciding which item rep to compile next (using the dependency graph)
* Deciding whether to use cached content or to actually recompile the item
* Compiling the actual item reps
