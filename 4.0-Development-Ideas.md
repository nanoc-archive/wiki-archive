Open questions
--------------

* Should the configuration be part of the source data? Given that the configuration also contains the configuration of things that are not part of core, it probably should not. Perhaps there should be a dedicated site metadata file?

* At what level should the rules be modeled? Perhaps this should not be part of core, so that an external subsystem can provide the processing instructions to the compiler.

* Should core be responsible for loading `lib/` files? I’d say it should not. This would allow using nanoc-core for GitHub pages.

* Should the preprocessor live in the content layer or the compilation layer? I’m in favour of sticking it in the content layer, because it can be used to generate proper content.
