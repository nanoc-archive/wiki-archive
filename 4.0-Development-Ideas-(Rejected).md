No Online Data Sources
----------------------

**Resolution:** Rejected. Not an implementation issue. The `sync` command can be used for this in 3.x.

nanoc 3.0 introduced online data sources, allowing data to be read from sources such as Twitter, Last.fm, Delicious, etc. Unfortunately, letting nanoc handle online data sources had some drawbacks:

* **It slows down the compilation process.** A `nanoc3 co` is no longer fast; the data first has to be fetched from various sources, which takes time.

* **It may even prevent the site from being compiled.** If the data can’t be fetched, nanoc3 will throw an error and refuse to compile the site. There is no way around this: letting nanoc compile the site regardless of data-loading errors may not work because some required data could be missing. For the same reason, uncommenting the data source in the configuration file is also not a good solution.

As far as I can see, there is only one way to solve these issues: the data-fetching stage should not be nanoc's responsibility. Instead, data should be downloaded and stored in a format recognisable by the used data source(s). **nanoc should still support multiple data sources** as this is one of nanoc’s strengths (even if it makes the configuration file a tad more confusing.

No more “filter” name
---------------------

**Resolution:** Rejected. The name “Filter” is okay.

“Filters” are not the right name for the text transformation objects that nanoc uses. Transformer? Transformator? Formatter? Processor?…
