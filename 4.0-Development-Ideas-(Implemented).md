**THIS PAGE HAS BEEN ARCHIVED.** Use the [nanoc 4.0 Trello board](https://trello.com/b/dlEWOOBW/nanoc-4-0) instead.

This page lists ideas that have been implemented in one way or another. **This page lists the original ideas only; do not rely on this page for documenting the final implementation.**

No special “index” treatment
----------------------------

**Goal:** Remove confusion about how “index” files are treated.  

Items and layouts with “index” as their name are handled in a special way. This was done to mimic the behavior of web servers serving index.html by default, but it has proven to be rather confusing so I would drop the special behavior entirely.

Powerful identifiers
--------------------

The trailing slash of item identifier is annoying and should be removed. For example, an item at `content/foo/bar/qux.html` would become `/foo/bar/qux`, not `/foo/bar/qux/`.

This will allow patterns in compilation and routing rules to be closer to filesystem globs. For example:

	# in nanoc 3.0.x, this rule will be applied to the item /foo/ as well as its
	# descendants (children, grandchildren, …). If item identifiers do not have
	# a trailing slash, this rule will be applied only to descendants of /foo, and
	# not to /foo itself.
	compile '/foo/*' do
	  # ...
	end
	
	# in nanoc 3.0.x, this rule will be applied to the descendants of /foo/. If
	# item identifiers do not have a trailing slash, this rule will not be applied
	# to anything (because no identifier ends with a trailing slash).
	compile '/foo/*/' do
	  # ...
	end

In order to remain backward compatible, comparison of item identifiers with strings should still work. For example, `@item.identifier == '/foo/bar/'` should still return true, even though the identifier is '/foo/bar'. Overriding `#==` is probably a bad idea, so maybe `#=~` could be used instead (would break compatibility, though). Identifiers would be represented using a `Identifier` class, which can be constructed from a `String`.

Identifiers are a source of confusion and should perhaps be removed. Compilation and routing rules could be applied to file paths directly, like this:

	compile '/*.html.erb' do
	  filter :erb
	end

	compile '/articles/*' do
	  # ... compile all articles here ...
	end

A drawback of this approach is that, when linking to an item, you must be sure to include the extension, like this:

	<%= link_to "The About Page", @items.find { |i| i.identifier == '/about.html' } %>

… which is pretty ugly. What if you’d want to rename `about.html` to `about.html.erb`, or `about.md`? You’d have to update all links, which is not pretty. Also: since items can still be routed, there is no clear distinction between item paths and item rep paths: `/about.html` could suddenly become `/about/index.html`, leading to more confusion that it’s worth.

There could be a method which returns a string equivalent to the nanoc3 identifier (something like File.dirname + File.basename where all semantic extensions have been removed)

	<%= link_to "The About Page", @items.find { |i| i.stem == '/about' } %>

This would have application in routing rules too: 

	route '/stylesheets/*' do
	  item.stem + '.css'
	end

	route '*' do
	  item.stem + '/index.html'
	end

One step further could be using a special entity for storing identifiers, and allowing them to be matched both with and without extension. For example:

	ident = Nanoc3::Identifier.new('/software/nanoc.md')
	ident =~ '/software/nanoc'        # => true
	ident =~ '/software/adsf'         # => false
	ident =~ '/software'              # => false
	ident =~ '/software/nanoc.md'     # => true
	ident =~ '/software/nanoc.wobble' # => false
	ident =~ '/software/*'            # => true
	ident =~ '/software/nanoc.*'      # => true
	ident =~ '/software/*.md'         # => true
	ident =~ '/software/*.xyz'        # => false

When comparing with a regular expression, the full identifier string with extension is used.

nanoc currently drops the “index/” suffix in item identifiers, so that a file at content/about/index.html becomes /about/ instead of /about/index/. Getting rid of this special case would simplify things and clear up some confusion.
